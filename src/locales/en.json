I'm Agustin, and I love my profession. <span>I fell deeply in love with programming</span>, and since then, I haven't stopped immersing myself in the world of technology. I hang out with a lot of tech geeks, and I consider myself one of them.<br/>Since I was young, I've always had a <span>curiosity</span> to understand how things worked. I would take apart every toy, game, or device that came into my hands with the goal of discovering how they worked the way they did. Then, with patience and dedication, I would put them back together so they could regain their functionality.<br/>As a tech enthusiast and web developer, I have focused on acquiring knowledge to become a <span>Frontend Developer</span>. I'm willing to share my experience and am always eager to receive constructive feedback that helps me continue to grow. I love learning and sharing! ‚ù§"
