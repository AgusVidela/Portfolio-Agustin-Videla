      "textContent": "üëã Hey! I‚Äôm Agustin, and technology is far more than just a profession to me‚Äîit‚Äôs a part of my everyday life. My passion for programming began the moment I wrote my first lines of code, and since then I‚Äôve fully dedicated myself to exploring and creating in the tech world. I‚Äôve always enjoyed surrounding myself with people who share the same enthusiasm, and I‚Äôm proud to be part of that community. Since I was young, I‚Äôve had the urge to understand how things work: whether it was toys, consoles, or gadgets, I would completely take them apart to study their mechanisms and then carefully reassemble them to ensure they worked again. Today, as a web enthusiast focused on Frontend Development, I aim to refine my skills, experiment with new ideas, and learn from every challenge. I love sharing knowledge, collaborating, and receiving feedback that helps me grow. For me, technology is not just about writing code‚Äîit‚Äôs about curiosity, creativity, and constant growth. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
